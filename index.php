                <p>I'm a(n almost) 21 year old college student majoring in Computer Science. I take pride in finding great music videos with under 1,000 views. I like solving problems. I like black risotto, MIKA, and Madeira (the island, not the wine). </p>

                <p>I like the web, I like technology, and I like art. That is why, on an uneventful summer night in August 2013, having nothing to do, I decided to become a web developer. Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">180 websites in 180 days</a>, I intend to learn something new every day, and apply it to a project. When I'm done I'll post it on my <a href="playground.php">playground</a>, so feel free to poke around.</p>

                <h2>Why hellosunschein?</h2>

                <p>Well, the explanation's pretty simple. My first name and two last names make it a bit awkward looking being mashed together in a username: <code>leamaroltsonnenschein</code><br>
                The lack of descenders makes it visually unappealing, and let's be honest... no one can actually say it out loud without breaking their tongue. So, that was a no-go. I needed to make it shorter.</p>

                <p>My second last name is German, and it means <em>"sunshine"</em> in English. Coincidentally, at the time of username creation, I was obsessed with the song <em>"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njaYAccqpqk">Hello Sunshine</a>"</em> by the <em>Super Fury Animals</em>, so it seemed like a natural choice (the fact that I was an angsty little teenager, binge watching The O.C., fangirling over Seth, and seeing him and Summer finally get together to that song's soundtrack clearly had nothing to do with it).</p>

                <h2>What am I doing?</h2>

                <p>First thing's first. As a computer science major, you get to do a bunch of straightforward projects and homework assignments, that aren't very interesting. Sure, it teaches you the basic concepts of a programming language or paradigm, but it doesn't really challenge you.</p>
                <p>Second thing, I really enjoy working on projects that have a visual result/output. I like working both on a functionality of project, as well as the presentation (for example mobile apps, those are pretty sweet).</p> 
                <p>So, I said to myself: <blockquote>"God dang it woman. Just challenge <em>yourself</em>! Find a way to creatively solve problems where you can apply both your technical skills, and your quirky aesthetic."</blockquote></p> <p>And this is how I found myself interested in web development (again).</p>
                <p>It's been years since I wrote my first HTML. CSS wasn't even a thing. Back then all you had to do was make a pretty picture, use it as the background, and absolute-position your elements like a crazy person.</p> 
            </div>
            
           <div class="col-lg-5">
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>Then there was CSS, and everything got SOOOO fanceh. Oh, how I loved the new minimalist-typography style mash that emerged. I could make a sick website with 3 colours and Georgia (in all its styles and weights) as my only tools ;)!</p>
                <p>Imagine my surprise when I looked into what this simple HTML/CSS junk evolved to over the past few years. There's CSS animations, transforms, gradients... You've got all sorts of preprocessors, frameworks, and approaches. You have to watch out for cross-browser compatibility, making your site responsive, you can even make your websites in mobile applications! It's gone totally haywire!</p>
                <p>There's your JavaScript and its countless libraries. Then there's Ruby and PHP, and all these other web keywords that made my head spin at first.</p>
                <p>One key thing I noticed, though, was that web development is actually a lot like CS. The skills I've gained in my classes can be directly applied to developing for the web.</p>
                <p>So this is where I'm at. I'm trying out new things, and I'm finding it much more exciting and rewarding than 2 years worth of CS classes. Everyone's been telling me that as a future job-seeker, you need to have personal projects, and I guess that this one's mine. I don't know how it's going to turn out, but I'm enjoying myself, and that's all that matters. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI">JFDI</a>.</p>
