                <h2>Why hellosunschein?</h2>

                <p>Well, the explanation's pretty simple. My first name and two last names are a bit awkward looking mashed together in a username: <em>leamaroltsonnenschein</em><br>
                The lack of descenders makes it visually unappealing, and let's be honest... no one can actually say it out loud without breaking their tongue. So, that was a no-go. I needed to make it shorter.</p>

                <p>My second last name is German, and it means <em>sunshine</em> in English. Coincidentally, at the time of username creation, I was obsessed with the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njaYAccqpqk">Hello Sunshine</a> by the <em>Super Furry Animals</em>, so it seemed like a natural choice (the fact that I was an angsty little teenager, binge watching The O.C., fangirling over Seth, and seeing him and Summer finally get together to that song's soundtrack clearly had nothing to do with it).</p>

                <h2>Personal statement</h2>

                <p>What I love doing most is <em>creating "things"</em>; whether they be <a href="#">mobile apps</a>, <a href="#">paintings</a>, <a href="#">screen prints</a>, or <a href="@">websites</a>. In everything that I do, I try to <em>challenge myself, and learn something new</em>, instead
                of just <em>reitrating what I've already done previously</em>. I'm not afraid to <em>try out different approaches</em>, if I see the current one isn't working, and I adapt well. I'm not afraid to <em>speak up and question decisions</em>, 
                if I don't think they're right, but at the same time, I <em>respect everyone's opinion</em>, and have no problem admitting that I'm wrong, if I've been proven so. I'm extremely <em>well organized</em>, and have, over the years, 
                developed a <em>great sense of time management</em>. I <em>take initiative</em>, and I'm able to teach myself and apply what I've learned. I try <em>thinking ahead</em>, and be on top of what's going on to be prepared for the future,
                especially in the field of technology. </p>

                <p>I'm a <em>perfectionist</em>, which sometimes drives my teammates crazy, and results in delaying the deployment or presentation
                of a project, but I don't want to let something go out in to the world if I'm not proud of it. I'm very <em>forgetful</em>, and I rely on a plethora of technology devices to stay focused and organized. Sometimes I <em>get
                discouraged by failures</em>, but I usually take it as a "lesson learned" kind of thing, and know not to do it again in the future. 
                I <em>hate talking about myself</em>, and this paragraph was one of the hardest things I've had to write. </p>

                <p>In the end, <em>I'm just a person</em>. I'm not perfect, I have flaws, and I make mistakes. But I'm always <em>trying to be better</em>. 
                I have a <em>passion for learning new things</em>, and seeing how I can use them to build something that will <em>improve</em> (even if only the tinniest bit) <em>someones life</em>. I have a <em>drive to create, and a will to succeed</em>.
