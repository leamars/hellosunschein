                <h2>Why hellosunschein?</h2>

                <p>Well, the explanation's pretty simple. My first name and two last names are a bit awkward looking mashed together in a username: <em>leamaroltsonnenschein</em><br>
                The lack of descenders makes it visually unappealing, and let's be honest... no one can actually say it out loud without breaking their tongue. So, that was a no-go. I needed to make it shorter.</p>

                <p>My second last name is German, and it means <em>sunshine</em> in English. Coincidentally, at the time of username creation, I was obsessed with the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njaYAccqpqk">Hello Sunshine</a> by the <em>Super Furry Animals</em>, so it seemed like a natural choice (the fact that I was an angsty little teenager, binge watching The O.C., fangirling over Seth, and seeing him and Summer finally get together to that song's soundtrack clearly had nothing to do with it).</p>

                <h2>What am I doing?</h2>

                <p>First thing's first. As a computer science major, you get to do a lot of cool stuff. But you get to do a bunch of <em>straightforward</em> projects and homework assignments, that aren't very interesting, as well. Sure, it teaches you the basic concepts of a programming language or paradigm, but it doesn't really <em>challenge you</em>.</p>
                <p>Second thing, I really enjoy working on projects that have a <em>visual result or output</em>. I like working both on a <em>functionality</em> of project, as well as the <em>presentation</em> (for example mobile apps, those are pretty sweet).</p> 
                <p>So, I said to myself: <blockquote>"God dang it woman. Just challenge <em>yourself</em>! Find a way to creatively solve problems where you can apply both your technical skills, and your quirky aesthetic."</blockquote></p> <p>And this is how I found myself interested in web development (again).</p>
                <p>It's been years since I wrote my first HTML. CSS wasn't even a thing. Back then all you had to do was make a <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v255/leamarschein/Graphics/Really%20Old/f.jpg">pretty picture</a> (I was 10, give me a break), use it as the background, and absolute-position your elements like a crazy person.</p> 
            </div>
            
           <div class="col-lg-5">
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>Then there was CSS, and everything got <em>SO fancy</em>. Oh, how I loved the new minimalist-typography style mash that emerged. I could spit out an awesome website with just 3 colors and Georgia!</p>
                <p>Imagine my surprise when I looked into what this simple HTML/CSS jungle evolved to over the past few years. There's <em>CSS animations</em>, <em>transforms</em>, <em>gradients</em>...</em> You've got all sorts of <em>preprocessors, frameworks</em>, and <em>approaches</em>. You have to watch out for <em>cross-browser compatibility</em>, making your site <em>responsive</em>, and you can even make <em>mobile applications</em>! It's gone totally haywire!</p>
                <p>There's your <em>JavaScript</em> and its countless libraries. Then there's <em>Ruby and PHP</em>, and all these other web keywords that made my head spin at first.</p>
                <p>One key thing I noticed, though, was that web development is actually <em>a lot like CS</em>. The skills I've gained in my classes can be directly applied to developing for the web.</p>
                <p>So this is where I'm at. I'm trying out new things, and I'm finding it much more exciting and rewarding than 2 years worth of CS classes. At the same time, I'm thankful for my CS education, because it's making the learning curver much less steep. Everyone's been telling me that as a future job-seeker, you need to have personal projects, and I guess that this one's mine. I don't know how it's going to turn out, but I'm enjoying myself, and that's all that matters. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI">JFDI</a>.</p>

                <p>At some point tomorrow, I swear I'll write a sort of personal statement here about me, but for today, I'm beat. No more writing for me. I should also probably make this 8 columns instead of 6, I think I'll go do that right now. Okay. Cool. I could really use some lorem ipsum right now, to fill up the content.
