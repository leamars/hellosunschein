                <h2>What am I doing?</h2>

                <p>First thing's first. As a computer science major, you get to do a lot of cool stuff. But you get to do a bunch of <em>straightforward</em> projects and homework assignments, that aren't very interesting, as well. Sure, it teaches you the basic concepts of a programming language or paradigm, but it doesn't really <em>challenge you</em>.</p>
                <p>Second thing, I really enjoy working on projects that have a <em>visual result or output</em>. I like working both on a <em>functionality</em> of project, as well as the <em>presentation</em> (for example mobile apps, those are pretty sweet).</p> 
                <p>So, I said to myself: <blockquote>"God dang it woman. Just challenge <em>yourself</em>! Find a way to creatively solve problems where you can apply both your technical skills, and your good eye for design."</blockquote></p> <p>And this is how I found myself interested in web development (again).</p>
                <p>It's been years since I wrote my first HTML. CSS wasn't even a thing. Back then all you had to do was make a <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v255/leamarschein/Graphics/Really%20Old/f.jpg">pretty picture</a> (I was 10, give me a break), use it as the background, and absolute-position your elements like a crazy person.</p>

           <div class="col-lg-5">
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>Then there was CSS, and everything got <em>SO fancy</em>. Oh, how I loved the new minimalist-typography style mash that emerged. I could spit out an awesome website with just 3 colors and Georgia!</p>
                <p>Imagine my surprise when I looked into what this simple HTML/CSS jungle evolved to over the past few years. There's <em>CSS animations</em>, <em>transforms</em>, <em>gradients</em>...</em> You've got all sorts of <em>preprocessors, frameworks</em>, and <em>approaches</em>. You have to watch out for <em>cross-browser compatibility</em>, making your site <em>responsive</em>, and you can even make <em>mobile applications</em>! It's gone totally haywire!</p>
                <p>There's your <em>JavaScript</em> and its countless libraries. Then there's <em>Ruby and PHP</em>, and all these other web keywords that made my head spin at first.</p>
                <p>One key thing I noticed, though, was that web development is actually <em>a lot like CS</em>. The skills I've gained in my classes can be directly applied to developing for the web.</p>
                <p>So this is where I'm at. I'm trying out new things, and I'm finding it much more exciting and rewarding than 2 years worth of CS classes. At the same time, I'm thankful for my CS education, because it's making the learning curver much less steep. Everyone's been telling me that as a future job-seeker, you need to have personal projects, and I guess that this one's mine. I don't know how it's going to turn out, but I'm enjoying myself, and that's all that matters. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=JFDI">JFDI</a>.</p>
